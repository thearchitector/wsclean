# wsclean

Reads and adjusts the contents of your clipboard by normalizing the whitespace. Made for the very specific use case of
copying content with a lot of erroneous whitespace, like OCR content from textbooks.

## Installation

First install with

```sh
pip install --user wsclean
```

then copy large chunks of misbehaving text and run `wsclean` to fix it.
